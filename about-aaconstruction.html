  <body>
  <p>AA Construction is a small project bidding company with only three people: the CEO, my coworker, and me.</p>
  <p>We help general contractors join our team and get projects. Once a project is approved, the contractor gets paid directly after they win a project bid. The company does not handle construction work ourselves.</p>
  <p>I make phone calls to general contractors to get them to work with our company. I do not handle their payment. I just bring them in and help them join our team.</p>

    <p> This is how we handle commercial construction project bids</p>

    <ol>
      <li> Identify a commercial project (department stores, malls, renovations, demolitions). </li>
      <li> Call seven subcontractors who can handle demolition, drywall framing, or painting in areas like New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, to name a few </li>
      <li> Collect quotes from subcontractors for the project. </li>
      <li> forward the quotes to my coworker, Jane, for administrative and technology handling.</li>
      <li> The CEO reviews the quotes and sends them to the head general contractor.</li>
      <li> Wait to see if the project is awarded to the client based on the submitted bid. </li>
     </ol>

    <p> Note: this process is for commercial projects only, not residential. My role is to make calls and gather quotes.  It is for commercial projects only, not residential. My role is to make calls and gather quotes from other general contractors on a  daily basis. </p>
