  <body>
  <p>AA Construction is a small project bidding company with only three people: the CEO, my coworker, and me.</p>
  <p>We help general contractors join our team and get projects. Once a project is approved, the contractor gets paid directly after they win a project bid. The company does not handle construction work ourselves.</p>
  <p>I make phone calls to general contractors to get them to work with our company. I do not handle their payment. I just bring them in and help them join our team.</p>
