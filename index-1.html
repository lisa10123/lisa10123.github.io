<h1>English 2720 Website Deliverables</h1>
  
<p>Dear Professor Ellis. </p>

<p>I hope you are doing well. I'm writing to share my website deliverable for English 2720.
The website presents my project materials in an organized, professional format that demonstrates my understanding of project bidding presentations. 
My intended audience is you and my English 2720 classmates, as well as anyone reviewing or exploring my course-related work.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lisa Davis</p>
