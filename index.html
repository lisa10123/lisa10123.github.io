  <h1 Project bidding process<h1>
    <p> This is how we handle commercial construction project bids</p>

    <ol>
      <li> Identify a commercial project (department stores, malls, renovations, demolitions).  </li>
      <li> Collect quotes from subcontractors for the project. </li>
      <li> forward the quotes to my coworker, Jane, for administrative and technology handling.</li>
      <li> The CEO reviews the quotes and sends them to the head general contractor for the bidding to begin.</li>
      <li> And then we wait to see if the project is awarded to the client based on the submitted bid. </li>
     </ol>

    <p> Note: this process is for commercial projects only, not residential. My role is to make calls and gather quotes.  It is for commercial projects only, not residential. My role is to make calls and gather quotes from other general contractors on a  daily basis. </p>
