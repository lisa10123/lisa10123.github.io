  <p>AA Construction is a small project bidding company with only three people: the CEO, my coworker, and me.</p>

  <p>I work as a sales representative for AA Construction on a commission-only basis. My job is to talk with general contractors to get project bids, keep track of project information, and make sure the bids are submitted correctly. I collect updates from contractors, organize information, and help projects move smoothly. I focus on representing the company professionally and keeping communication clear with AA Construction workers in Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, just to name a few.</p>

  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <p>Commission sales representative at AA Construction – commission only, no base salary.</p>

  <h2>Organizing Phone Calls</h2>
  <p>Phone calls to clients using a list from the system, with all information sent to my coworker, who handles data entry and technical tasks.</p>

  <h1>Project Bidding Process</h1>
  <p>This is how we handle commercial construction project bids:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify commercial projects (department stores, malls, renovation, demolition).</li>
    <li>Collect quotes from subcontractors for the project.</li>
    <li>Forward the quote to my coworker, Jane, for administrative and technical handling.</li>
    <li>The CEO reviews the quote and sends it to the head general contractor for bidding to begin.</li>
    <li>Then we wait to see if the project is awarded to the client based on the submitted bid.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This process is for commercial projects only, not residential.</p>
  <p>My work is to make calls and gather quotes from other general contractors on a daily basis.</p>
