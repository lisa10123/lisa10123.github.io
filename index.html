    <p>AA Construction is a small project bidding company with only three people: the CEO, my coworker, and me.</p>
    <p>I work as a sales representative for AA Construction on a commission basis. My job is to talk with general contractors to get project bids, keep track of project information, and make sure the bids are submitted correctly. I collect updates from contractors, organize information, and help projects move smoothly. I focus on representing the company professionally and keeping communication clear with AA Construction workers in Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, just to name a few.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>Commission sales representative at AA Construction (commission only, no base salary)</p>
    <h1>Organizing Phone Calls</h1>
    <p>I make phone calls to clients using a list from the system and forward all information to my coworker, who handles data entry and technical tasks.</p>
    <h1>Project Bidding Process</h1>
    <p>This is how we handle commercial construction project bids:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Identify a commercial project (department stores, malls, renovations, demolitions).</li>
        <li>Collect quotes from subcontractors for the project.</li>
        <li>Forward the quotes to my coworker, Jane, for administrative and technical handling.</li>
        <li>The CEO reviews the quotes and sends them to the head general contractor for the bidding to begin.</li>
        <li>Then we wait to see if the project is awarded to the client based on the submitted bid.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: This process is for commercial projects only, not residential. My role is to make calls and gather quotes from other general contractors on a daily basis.</p>
